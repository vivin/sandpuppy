Vectorization approach 1:

 - 0: number of mallocs
 - 1: number of callocs
 - 2: number of frees
 - 3: number of unique sizes
 - 4: number of unique addresses

Vectorizaion approach 2 is approach 1 plus:

 - 5-66: number of chunks allocated with size 16, 24, ..., 504
 - 67: chunks with size greater than 512K??

OR we use a logarithmic bins? 1-16, 17-48, 49-112 and so on?

Vectorization approach 3:

Like 1, but we split up by basic block. so 0...n is number of malloc calls, but per basic block.
